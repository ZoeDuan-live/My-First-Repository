# My-First-Repository
Recorde how I learn to use Github. I'll continue to update tips I've learned.

The first thing I recommend every biginner to do is reading the "GitHub Giudes". I have spent a lot of time finding tutorials from other experts. However, I finally realized that most of them assumed you already have the basic knowledge about GitHub, whereas it's not. Fortunately, I find the "GitHub Giudes" is clear and easy enough for us tyro. Please read the "GitHub Giudes" and follow the guides to start exploring GitHub!
